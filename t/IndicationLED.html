<p>evive has 1 single-colour and 2 dual-colour programmable LEDs, along with fixed LEDs for serial communication, power indication and battery charging status.</p>
<h2><strong>Single Colour Programmable LED:</strong></h2>
<p>A single colour LED is connected to digital pin 13 of Arduino Mega, which is programmable and can be controlled via digitalWrite() or analogWrite() functions.</p>

<h2><strong>Dual-colour Programmable LED:</strong></h2>
<p>Two dual-colour programmable LEDs are attached to digital pins 28 and 29 for first LED and digital pin 30 and 31 for second LED. By controlling the output of one of the pin, you can control one colour of the LED and by controlling the second colour. Both the LEDs are common cathode LEDs, which means that the common terminal is GND and when the other pins are given HIGH, the LED glows.</p>

/*
 evive inbuit bi-directional LED code

 Bi-directional LED 1 is connected to digital pin 28 and 29.
 Bi-directional LED 2 is connected to digital pin 30 and 31.

 This code demonstrates how to use evive inbuilt biderectional LEDs.
 The code turns on and off a bi-dectional LED connected to digital
 pin 28 and 29, when sliding the slideswitch to either sides connected to digital pin 40 and 41.

<h2><strong>Non-Programmable LEDs:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Serial Communication LED: evive has 4 serial communication channels. For the first channel a dual-colour LED is connected, which glow when the communication happens from the channel.</li>
<li>Power Indication LED: This LED glows when evive is powered via any source (Internal battery or external power source).</li>
<li>Battery charging LED: This LED constantly glows when the internal battery is charging, and blinks when there is no internal battery connected to evive.</li>
