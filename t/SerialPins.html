<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Serial Pins</strong></h1>
<p>Serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus.</p>
<p>For evive, serial is used for communication between evive and a computer or any other devices. It has four serial ports available: Serial0 on pins 0 (RX0) and 1 (TX0), Serial1 on pins 19 (RX1) and 18 (TX1), Serial2 on pins 17 (RX2) and 16 (TX2), Serial3 on pins 15 (RX3) and 14 (TX3).</p>

<p>While communication with the computer, evive uses serial port 0 via USB. Thus, if you use these functions, you cannot also use pins 0 and 1 for digital input or output. But communication with HC05 (Bluetooth), ESP8266 (WiFi) or Xbee is done via serial port 3. Do not use digital pins 14 and 15 while using any of the three device.</p>
