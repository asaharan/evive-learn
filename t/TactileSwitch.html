<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tactile Switches</strong></h1>
<p>The two tactile switches are connected to Arduino pins 38 and 39, both active high. This means that the pins are at +5V when the switch is pressed, and at 0V (Ground) otherwise.</p>
<img src="images/evive_Pushbuttons.png" width="500">
<p>Note that pins 38, 39 are pulled low, i.e. they will be at 0V (and not floating) when the switch is not pressed</p>
<p>The test code for the tactile switch is given below:</p>

 evive inbuilt pushbutton code

 Pushbutton 1 is connected to digital pin 38.
 Pushbutton 2 is connected to digital pin 39.
 
 This code demonstrates how to use evive inbuilt tactile switches.
 The code turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital
 pin 13, when pressing a pushbutton.

// set pin numbers:
int buttonPin = 38;     // the number of the pushbutton 1 pin

  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
  // open serial port, set data rate at 9600 bps:
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
